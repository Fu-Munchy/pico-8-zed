# Pico-8 language server for Zed

Pico-8 is a fantasy console by [Lexaloffle](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), where the language is built on [version 5.2 of Lua](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html).

This extension provides [pico-8 language server](https://github.com/japhib/pico8-ls) for Zed code editor.
It uses the tree-sitter grammar from [tree-sitter lua](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-lua/tree/main) and reuses grammar code from the [Zed Lua](https://github.com/zed-extensions/lua) extension. 


The code found in src/lib.rs is in its **entirety generated by AI**.

For me, this project is a step into zed extension building, and learning rust. The extension was built mainly to learn how rust is used to make zed extensions. AI was used to learn how the zed_extension API should be used. I will be inspecting this code closely while continuing to learn rust - and perhaps re-write this extension in the future. 

For now, I will leave the extension as is.


## Installation
### From source
The extension needs to be installed via downloading the source code (in a chosen directory),
and installing it as a [Dev Extension in Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/developing-extensions?highlight=dev%20extensions#developing-an-extension-locally).

From there, open a .lua file, and select the pico8-ls as the language server *and* set the language of the file to Pico-8.
This will enable the correct language server and appropriate syntax highlighting, respectively.

### Zed Extension Manager
**As I have yet to review the code in src/lib.rs, I will not be publishing the extension to Zed until then.**
